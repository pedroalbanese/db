### CSV-based DB
The CSV-based DB tool is a database based on CSV, which means it stores and manipulates data in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format.

The goal of CSV-based DB is to provide a simple and lightweight solution for data management using CSV files. This approach can be useful in scenarios where a full database is not required or when working with CSV files is preferred for ease of portability and integration with other tools.

The tool allows users to perform basic database operations such as data insertion, querying, updating, and deletion in CSV files.
Overall, CSV-based DB offers a straightforward and efficient alternative for data management using CSV files, enabling users to store and manipulate data easily and flexibly.
